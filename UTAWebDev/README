-----CITE 1 -------

These two web pages are for the same "fake" business. Cite one is a basic web form that takes in user information,
the page validates whether user filled out information where information is required
If information is left empty the web page shifts focus on to whatever needs to be filled out.


-----CITE 2 ------

Cite two keeps the same theme used in previous cite. On this cite I utilize cookies to change the website content
depending on the user information provided to the website. A timer is also initiated at during page load to generate 
a random number. If random number meets condition then user is prompted and directed to cite 1 web form 


------CITE 3 -----
Final product of my web development course project. It includes the two pages created before, plus 3 other pages. 
At the time of creating the first two files I wasn't in the know of how my professor wanted us to structure the website. 
In hindsight in order to get familiar with githubs interface and core functions, it would have been best to have one file 
with which I updated to more recent versions. But now that it is setup like this, i will continue to make changes to Cite 3, as 
I plan on adding on adding more to it.
