-----CITE 1 -------

These two web pages are for the same "fake" business. Cite one is a basic web form that takes in user information,
the page validates whether user filled out information where information is required
If information is left empty the web page shifts focus on to whatever needs to be filled out.


-----CITE 2 ------

Cite two keeps the same theme used in previous cite. On this cite I utilize cookies to change the website content
depending on the user information provided to the website. A timer is also initiated at during page load to generate 
a random number. If random number meets condition then user is prompted and directed to cite 1 web form
