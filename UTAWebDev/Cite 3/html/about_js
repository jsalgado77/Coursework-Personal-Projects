    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <p class="aboutP">From humble beginnings our co-founders started off as beginners buying any cheap equipment they could get their hands on.
        As their passion grew and their expertise deepened, they found themselves in hobby that was scarce in equipment yet plagued
        with outrageous wait and delivery times. The community was in need of an entity that would be driven by pure passion to better the situation. 
        Thats exactly what Jason and Musk sought out to do when starting up Kale's Keyboards in 2004. And now, 18 years later we are the biggest business 
        in the keyboard scene. Providing thousands of products to our loyal customers in record speeds never seen before in the hobby, and we take pride in that.
